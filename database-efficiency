we need to find which kind of database structure would be suitable for the project.it need to be lite
and easily accessibly to the code as it may be needed to be accessed quite often.it should implement
least use of the processor and memory to become an efficient structure.

we can either use file handling in this case, but to create such web, maybe more than just 2-3 files
  need to be made and all have to be connected simultaneously.this could complex the code but speaking
  for myself, if this tends to be efficient in the big picture, then the code
is not a big deal at all.

or maybe we can use DBMS (SQL) tables for such case where all different hierarchical phases could
become columns and the words under them as the content.in this case the table would require to be 
connected to the code for until the program is running.if this can turn out to be efficient then i'll be glad.
