we were thinking of what kind of relations we can logically generate between words to implement in our game.

sudden a idea struck us, why not use pre- baked logistics. where can we find a set of words that are already
logically sound to put in such a vast concept, the first option that came is the only option we were looking
for, i,e,# BOOKs.it can provide us most of the common sensible relations without any physical effort. lets try
it out. we will update the page when we will come with all the solutions required to inherit such concept in our
source code.
