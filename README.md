# project-wordweb
just a small conceptual game under construction

# Basic concept behind the game
th foundation of this project is to make a game where you would be given a word as a starting point and will be asked to reach another randomly selected distinct word. the way as you play will be that all words will be linked to each other in a relative pattern between the words..

as you select any word linked to the word that you are at then all words linked to that word will be displayed.and so on you can move forward in the game. the less steps you take to reach the final word, the better.

#the word relation:
the most delicate part of this project is the relation between words, because the word need not only link to a hierarchical format but also in between the hierarchical phases too. so that the links could create a web like structure.
we are still working on finding a well defined and suitable relation that could be confusing and understandable for any player. if the relation would not be understandable to the user then the game will become a luck-by-chance game, thats why making sense in the links is also a priority.
